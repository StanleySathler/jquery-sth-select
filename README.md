## :fire: What is the `sth-select`?
A select component built on top of jQuery optimized for mobile platforms.

#### What you mean with "optimized for mobile platforms"?
Most of custom select components do not have a good usability on mobile devices. Although many mobile browsers today implement a "native modal" alternative, native selects still look bad in desktop browsers. Also, sometimes, does not work well when there is not free space available in the screen.

#### How does the `sth-select` solve the problem?
After click on the select component, it opens up a little section from the bottom of the screen. This behaviour fits well both on big screens or small ones (mobile devices).

#### Damn it, homie! Now you made me excited!
Of course you are! This component is awesome!

## :fire: How can I use it? Please, help me!
Wait, little grasshopper. We are not going to leave you in the lurch after made you excited with this awesome component.

### HTML API
Creating a simple component just requires you add the `sth-select` attribute to your tag:
```html
<select sth-select></select>
```

Also, you can add a **title** which appears on your select's popup:
```html
<select
	sth-select
	sth-select-title="A title"
></select>
```

You might want to add a **placeholder** to your select when no item is selected.
```html
<select
	sth-select
	sth-select-placeholder="A placeholder"
></select>
```

Sometimes, you have a lot of items and want to be able to **search** by them. **But be aware:** we have not the best search algorithm yet.
```html
<select
	sth-select
	sth-select-filter="true"
></select>
```

Oh, and almost forgot: the filter field can also has a custom placeholder:
```html
<select
	sth-select
	sth-select-filter-placeholder="Search for an item"
></select>
```
