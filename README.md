## Attention!!
This component is **under development and may have a lot of bugs and inconsistency**. It can't even work. I started this little project so I could learn more about **webpack**, **jQuery plugin creation** and some other stuff.

## What is the `sth-select`?
A select component built in jQuery optimized for mobile platforms.

### What you mean with "optimized for mobile platforms"?
Most of custom select components do not have a good usability on mobile devices. They have small selectable options; sometimes are hidden due to the missing available space; etc.

### How does the `sth-select` solve the problem?
After click on the select component, it opens up a little section from the bottom of the screen. This behaviour fits well both on big screens or small ones (mobile devices).

### Damn it, homie! Now you made me excited!
Of course you are! This component is awesome!

## Installation instructions
